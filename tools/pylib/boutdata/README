BOUT++ Variable loading routine

Dependencies
====================

o Scipy/Numpy		For manipulations of arrays
o BOUT python routines	For collection of the data

Scripts available
====================

o loadvariable.py

A front-end to the collect routines which displays to the user all the variables in a BOUT file
(as determined in the source code), its dimensions and allows the user to slice up the arrays
if they have 4 dimensions. Currently allows the user to save the data to numpy format.

o guiloadvariable.py

A (mostly abandoned) project to write a GUI frontend to the above routine.
